# Understanding the Trend of Kakao Webtoon Indonesia
### About Kakao Webtoon
Kakao Webtoon is a popular digital platform for webtoons (online comics), launching in Indonesia in 2022. The service was originally established in 2003 by Daum and operating under Kakao post-merger in 2014. With its vast collection of titles, Kakao offers a diverse range of genres and styles, from action-packed adventures to heartwarming romances. The platform has gained a large and loyal following in Indonesia, and its popularity can also be seen at the platform in other languages, such as Korean, Thai, and Taiwan.

### About This Project
This project was done to understand if there's any genre that is consistently more popular among the existing ones from Kakao Webtoon particularly in the Indonesian market, using data from their web page. Data of all existing titles were retrieved from the sitemap of the home URL and data from each title was scraped using BeautifulSoup, then cleaned and exported using Python, and visualized in Tableau.
